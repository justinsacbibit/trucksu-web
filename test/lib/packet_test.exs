defmodule PacketTest do
  @moduledoc """
  This module tests that the Packet module packs data into the correct
  binary format.

  Words in packets are represented in little-endian format. This means
  that a 16-bit integer with a value of 5 will be represented as
    0x50 in hex, which is
    0b01010000

  The overall format of a packet is
    packet ID (int16) - The purpose of the packet, e.g. user login/logout
    empty byte (0x0)
    data length (int32) - The length of the following data (number of bytes)
    data - Packet data
